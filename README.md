## About
Emacount is a web application of counting scores between teams during parties.

For exemple, if you want to make a Angels vs Devils' party, you may want to have this application. Each person choose a side and each time he by a drink, his team earn a point!

It may look very simple and not very intersting but it can be terrible if you manage the ambience very well during your party.

This application was created by Guillaume FAYEMI and Ludovic SINTES, students of l'Ecole des mines d'Alès in France.
